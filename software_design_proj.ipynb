        "What is your project idea about?\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea is for children to create a story given multiple options. Essentially, it is a Create Your Own Adventure, where each option the user selects will lead to a different series of options, forming its own \"story\" of sorts. Users will be presented with multiple options at different points in the story, and their choices will determine the direction of the narrative.\n",
        "\n",
        "Describe your design for main packages, classes, methods, functions, and iterations between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Classes: Story: Represents a single story, containing a series of connected narrative nodes. Node: Represents a decision point or event in the story, containing text and references to possible choices.\n",
        "Methods/Functions: Story.create_story(): Generates a new story with predefined decision points and narrative text. Story.display_current_node(): Displays the current narrative text and available choices to the user. Story.make_choice(choice): Allows the user to select an option and progresses the story accordingly.\n",
        "Data Structures: Hash Tables: Used to store the story data efficiently, with nodes indexed by unique identifiers. Graph: Represents the structure of the story, with nodes as decision points and edges as the connections between choices.\n",
        "Algorithm Type: Graph Algorithms: To traverse the story graph and navigate between nodes based on user choices. This includes depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to explore the story paths.\n",
        "Interactions: Initialize a new story graph and hash table to store nodes. Create nodes representing decision points and connect them based on user-defined choices. Display the current node's text and available choices to the user. Prompt the user to make a choice and update the story graph accordingly. Repeat steps 3-4 until reaching the end of the story or a terminal node.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Design some Test cases that can test the correctness of your software.\n",
        "Story Creation Test Case: to test whether the application correctly creates a story with predefined decision points and narrative text. Node Connection Test Case: to ensure that nodes are properly connected based on user-defined choices, and the graph structure reflects the story's branching paths. Graph Traversal Test Case: to test the graph traversal algorithms to ensure they correctly navigate through the story graph based on user choices. End Test Case: to check whether the application correctly handles reaching the end of the story and provides appropriate feedback or prompts for the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is your current expectations of your software? For example, do you expect that it works well? What are the expected weaknesses?\n",
        "\n",
        "Node Representation: One challenge is determining the appropriate representation of nodes in the story graph. Each node represents a decision point or narrative segment in the story, and it needs to store information such as the text of the narrative, the options available to the user at that point, and the connections to other nodes based on user choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Graph Algorithms: Incorporating graph algorithms to navigate through the story graph adds another layer of complexity. Algorithms such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) may be used to traverse the graph and determine the possible paths and outcomes of the story based on user choices.\n",
